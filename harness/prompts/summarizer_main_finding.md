# Summarizer instructions

You get a table of files from a data bucket. Each row is one file, or one kind of file represented by a sample. Code has already extracted what you can read about it.

For each input row, return one output row that describes that unit.

## Input columns

- `unit_id`: the file's S3 URI, or a prefix plus a glob for a kind of file.
- `unit`, `file_type`, `members`, `example_keys`, `size_bytes`: what the row stands for. `members` above 1 means many files of the same kind; describe the kind, not just the sample.
- `excerpt_method`: how the excerpt was made, including any truncation.
- `excerpt`: the extracted content.
- `mentions`: passages from nearby README, Markdown or XML files that name the unit.

## Output columns

- `unit_id`: copied from the input.
- `what`: one of `readme`, `manifest`, `data-table`, `data-record`, `metadata`, `parameters`, `config`, `article`, `supplement`, `variants`, `code`, `log`, `other`.
- `summary`: one or two plain sentences, at most 300 characters, on what the unit is and contains. For an article, say what kind of study it is and what it is about, and state its main finding.
- `about`: subject terms, such as organism, cell line, structure, assay, compound, disease or method.
- `entities`: named things the unit states, each `{"type": ..., "value": ...}` with type one of `person`, `organization`, `software`, `instrument`, `identifier`, `license`, `url`, `date`.
- `refers_to`: other files, folders or file patterns the unit names.
- `evidence`: short quotes, each at most 200 characters, copied exactly from the row's `excerpt` or `mentions`, that support what you wrote.

## Rules

1. Use only the row's excerpt and mentions. Don't use outside knowledge, and don't reason about other rows.
2. Every evidence quote must appear word for word in the excerpt or mentions. Code checks this and rejects rows that fail.
3. If something isn't stated, leave it out. Empty lists are fine. `evidence` needs at least one quote.
4. Don't describe what was cut off. If the excerpt is truncated, describe what's there.
5. Return exactly one output row per input row, with the same `unit_id`.
